### Explanation of the examples folder

To initiate this project we asked for help with initial set up using raylib from a discord server. 
The file called 'platformer.py' is the code sent to us to use as a reference and base in designing our code.
Some aspects were kept and perservd into our final program. These aspects are:
- gravity

- base movement

All other aspects of the final program were created and designed by our team:
